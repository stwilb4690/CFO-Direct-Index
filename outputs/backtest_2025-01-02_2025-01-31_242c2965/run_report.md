## Assumptions & Limitations

1. **Survivorship Bias**: Uses current S&P 500 constituents for the entire backtest period. Historical index changes are not reflected.

2. **Execution**: Assumes perfect execution at closing prices. No slippage or market impact is modeled.

3. **Corporate Actions**: Adjusted prices are used, which account for splits and dividends, but complex corporate actions may not be reflected.

4. **Wash Sales**: Wash sale risks are flagged but not fully enforced. A 30-day window is tracked.

5. **Transaction Costs**: No transaction costs or bid-ask spreads are included.
